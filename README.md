# Project Overview

This project was created to demonstrate an example of how to work on a Python-based project. It includes examples of how to structure modules, manage configurations, and integrate with Docker for containerization.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a small glimpse into the typical setup and development workflow of a Python project. This includes setting up modular code, managing project settings, and utilizing tools for better development practices. It should serve as a basic template or inspiration for your own Python projects.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: The project is structured with separate modules to maintain code readability and reusability.
- **Configuration Management**: Settings and configurations are managed in a centralized way, making it easy to adjust project-specific variables.
- **Docker Integration**: Includes a Dockerfile for containerization, making it easy to set up and run the application in a consistent environment.
- **Documentation**: Example of how to document code and provide guidance for other developers.

## Note
This repository contains only a small part of the files to demonstrate the overall approach to project organization, modular coding, and containerization with Docker. It is intended for educational purposes and as a starting point for further development.
